# Developing Data Products Course Project

This app allows users to manipulate data and to see the results of their manipulations with a plot.  
The data that is used in this app is from R airquality datasets.

The airquality is a data frame with 154 observations on 6 variables (Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day)

To use the app:
1. Select a specific Month or "All months"
2. Check the variable that will be plotted with Temperature
3. Check the box "Display data based on the Wind value" to see data plotted based on the Wind size
4. Check the box "Add the Regression Line" to view the the line

The outcome of the plot shows:
1. If there is any relationship between Ozone and Temperature or Solar.R and Temperature
2. The high and low temperature in the selected time period
3. The difference between the high and low temperature in the selected time period
